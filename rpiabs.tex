\specialhead{ABSTRACT}
Daylighting plays a significant role in architecture; its creative and efficient use offers aesthetics visuals, increased productivity, and reduced energy demand. However, poor implementation of daylighting systems can have adverse effects such as visual discomfort, solar heat gain, and an absence of energy savings. \\

As a result, architects turn to daylight analysis to predict daylight's affects on architectural spaces prior to construction. However, there are several challenges in daylight analysis that make prediction non-trivial and time intensive. Specifically, there are numerous factors to consider when visualizing daylight in an interior space. Daylight can vary depending on the season, the time of day, the cardinal direction of fenestrations, the geographic location , the spatial geometry, and the reflectance of materials. \\

Traditional approaches to daylight analysis require either the construction of physical scale model or development of virtual 3D models. Both methods are time intensive and can cause delays in the fast-paced schematic design phase of architecture. \\

I present a novel online sketching interface for simulations (OASIS) that is easily accessible to non-experts, providing them with the ability to generate 3D models for daylight simulation from 2D architectural sketches. 
This online sketching interface allows users to both quickly create 3D models and perform qualitative  daylight analysis.

I propose that the online sketching interface for simulations(OASIS) is accessible and easy-to-use for both experts and novices.
Additional, I speculate that OASIS a step in the right direction as an early design tool for daylighting analysis.
My contributions include the development of OASIS, the conduction of an online pilot user study, and the analysis of results from that study. \\
