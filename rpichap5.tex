\chapter{Pilot User Study Results And Analysis} \label{sec:results}
In this chapter,  I cover the results of our pilot user study.
To begin, we cover feedback  about users that participated in our study.
Including their experience with architecture and 3D modeling software.
We then cover feedback on user's experience with our sketching interface.
Users clarify elements of  our sketching interface they liked, disliked, and found confusing.  
Users are also given a chance to provide feedback about future features that would add flexibility to their designs.
I then cover user feedback in regards to users' 3D interpretations of their sketches.
Lastly, we go over if users found the daylighting portion of OASIS as informative and effective.
Overall, the number of users who provided feedback is low, however given the span of two weeks and minimal advertising the results are promising.



\section{Participants Background Feedback}

In the two week timespan that OASIS was publicly available 57 users registered and participated in our pilot user study.
I recruited participants for our pilot user study from social media outlets and online bulletin boards; specifically, we advertised OASIS on Facebook\cite{todo} and subreddits\cite{todo} that share relevant interest to daylighting and architecture. Also note that at the  current time of this study, OASIS was yet to be advertised to students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Moreover, both Facebook and Reddit have a wide range of users with varying experiences.

Figure-\ref{fig:rpi_affilation} shows the affiliation of participants who registered on OASIS.
As shown in Figure-\ref{fig:rpi_affilation} a majority of participants that provided their affiliation are not affiliated with RPI. 
This is a big change from previous user studies, where all the participants were RPI affiliated.
Additionally, Figure-\ref{fig:rpi_affilation} shows that the majority of participants that are affiliated with RPI, are undergraduates.
It is also interesting that the majority of participants did not provide information on their affiliation with RPI.
This could be either because they did not notice the feedback questions on OASIS, or chose not to answer these questions.
Checking if users answered other feedback questions might provide insight as to whether users did not notice this question or purposefully skipped it. 
Specifically, 65\% of participants did not provide feedback on their affiliation, and not all participants who claimed to be affiliated with RPI specified how they were affiliated;
About 2\% of participants have unknown affiliations with RPI.
The difference between RPI affiliated participants and non-RPI affiliated participants could be a direct result of when we recruited participants for the pilot user study.
During the pilot user study we advertised towards non-RPI affiliated users and did not yet advertise to RPI affiliated users.

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{rpi_affilation}
	\caption{User affiliations of participants on OASIS}
	\label{fig:rpi_affilation}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{exp_edu}
	\caption{Architecture and visual arts experience of OASIS participants }
	\label{fig:exp_edu}
	\end{figure}

Similarly, I asked our participants about their experience with architecture and visual arts.
Figure-\ref{fig:exp_edu} shows the distribution of participants' formal education and job experience in both fields of architecture and the visual arts.
A majority of our participants expressed that they have no experience with any of the related fields;
As a result, these participants will be referred to as non-experts or novices.
Also a majority of those participants that have experience, generally have only 1-4 years of exposure to formal architecture education or formal visual arts education.
However, there is one user registered on OASIS that claims to have over 10 years of job experience in architecture.
Aside from asking about architecture and visual arts experience, I also let participants elaborate on other relevant experiences. 
Some of our participants have had experience in civil engineering, electrical engineering, studio arts, user experience design, and architectural engineering with a focus in lighting.
While our current set of participants does not have much experience with architecture, they do encompass a broad range of related fields.\\

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{software_exp}
	\caption{Participants' experience with 3D Modeling Softwares}
	\label{fig:software_exp}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, I also asked participants to provide a list of 3D modeling software they have had exposure to.
As seen in Figure-\ref{fig:software_exp} participants have had the most experience with AudoCad\cite{todo} and SketchUp\cite{todo}. 
A few participants have had experience with 3dsMax\cite{todo} and Maya\cite{todo}.
Again, we let participants elaborate on their experience with other 3D modeling software. 
Other 3D modeling software, not shown in Figure-\ref{fig:software_exp}, that participants have had experience using include SolidWorks\cite{todo}, AGI32\cite{todo}, Dialux\cite{todo}, and Daysim\cite{todo}.
Note that AGI32, Dialux, and Daysim are not specifically 3D modeling tools but rather used for daylight analysis and performance.
From user feedback collected in our pilot user study on participants' affiliations, experience in related fields, and exposure to modeling software, shows that OASIS was used by a wide variety of users.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{time_oasis_hist}
	\caption{Distribution of time spent on OASIS per user}
	\label{fig:time_oasis_hist}
\end{figure}

In addition to observing if OASIS was used by a broad range of users, I also wanted user feedback on the usability of OASIS.
Analyzing data on how participants spend their time  on OASIS can provide insight on user behavior.
Figure-\ref{fig:time_oasis_hist} illustrates the distribution of participants in relation to their time spent on OASIS.
Note that OASIS keeps track of the amount of time users spend on each page by timing when a user visits and leaves a page. We make the assumption that users who stay on the page for longer than an hour are non-active and time they spend on that page is not valid.
From Figure-\ref{fig:time_oasis_hist} it is clear that the majority of users registered and participating in the pilot user study spent no time on the actual interface.
On the other hand, the average time spent per participant is about 12 minutes, excluding participants that do not spend longer than a minute on OASIS past registration.
Although our user retention rate is low, I suspect that the voluntary nature, anonymity, and absence of renumeration in our pilot user study plays a significant role in the large number of participants who register and do not use OASIS.
Also  the large number of participants who register and do not use OASIS  could be a direct result of not having a tutorial for most of the pilot user study.
Users who are confused as to what to do on OASIS might have just left before creating a model.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{time_chart}
	\caption{Breakdown of time spent on OASIS pages}
	\label{fig:time_chart}
\end{figure}

Figure-\ref{fig:time_chart} illustrates participants' time spent on OASIS per page.
Moreover, Figure-\ref{fig:time_chart} shows that participants spend 36\% of their time on the \textit{ Sketch a Room} page.
Next participants spend 23\% of their time on the \textit{Create/Load Model} page.
It is important to note that first-time users have the option of viewing a short tutorial video; 
the 1 minute long tutorial video coupled with redirection to the \textit{Create/Load Model} page after logging in, could directly contribute to the large portion of time participants spend on the \textit{Create/Load model} page.
Surprisingly, the page participants spend the least amount of time is on the \textit{Analyze Simulation} page. 
On the \textit{Analyze Simulation} page users can view daylight renderings of user designed models.
On average participants spent only 8\% of their time analyzing their designed models;
when compared to the 25\% of time participants spend on viewing 3D interpretations on the \textit{Generate 3D model} page, the time spend on the \textit{Analyze Simulation} page seems remarkably low.
We expect users spend a majority of their time on creating sketches and analyzing daylight simulation results.
Stressing the importance of daylight analysis in an updated tutorial video might help guide users to the \textit{Analyze Simulation} page.
The difference between time spend on these two pages could stem from the fact that the \textit{Analyze Simulation} page is the final page new users visit when navigating OASIS linearly.
Furthermore, all of the temporal data collected on pages in OASIS could be effected by time spent writing feedback questions, multi-tasking while leaving OASIS running in the background, and leaving OASIS before visiting all pages.
 
\section{Usability Feedback}

Most of the feedback collected on the usability of OASIS is qualitative.
Quantitative boolean feedback would not fully capture how participants are experiencing our sketching interface;
As a result, I collect qualitative feedback to gain insight into how users perceive OASIS.
Table-\ref{fig:fun} list feedback collected from 14 participants concerning what participants found fun or interesting in our sketching environment.
Overall, 6 of the participants mentioned that the interface was either fun or easy-to-use.
However, some participants found window placement non-intuitive; 
other participants had difficulty with the limited primitives we provide.
While, we did not explicitly ask for what users found difficult in this specific feedback question, their response will be taken into consideration.
The participant who found window placement difficult states that they tried to ``leave a gap between walls to define where to place windows''.
I suspect that the participant, with this issue, must have not seen the tutorial video or not consulted any of the help options on OASIS.
A solution to this would be to automatically generate a users' first sketch as a simple shoe-box room with a single window. This would provide a concrete example they can base future sketches on as they learn how to use OASIS.
By the same token I speculate that the other participant, concerned with the limited options on OASIS, is most likey comparing our tool to other more fully featured modeling software.
As stated before, we intent for OASIS to be an early design tool for use during the schematic design phase of architecture.
As a result, for the pilot study I did not prioritize our selection of furniture items, but chose three pieces of furniture found commonly in bedrooms and dormitories.
Interestingly, our only participant with over 10 years of architectural job experience stated that the sketching interface was ``very simple'' and that that they never encountered a model that could not be interpreted correctly. Although we could get excited about this claim, more users would be required before any statistically significant conclusions about OASIS can be drawn.
Other participants claim they find specific features interesting, including the furniture items we support, skylights, and the daylight simulations.

\begin{table}[!ht]

\end{tabular}
\caption{Feedback to the question: What did you find fun or interesting in this sketching environment?}
\label{fig:fun}
\end{table}

We also asked participants to provide additional features we could add to our sketching interface to extend the flexibility of OASIS.
The two of the most common features requested by participants are the addition of doors on the sketching interface and a wider variety of furniture items.
Also, some participants desired more control over primitives on the sketching interface. 
Including both drag and drop mechanics on walls after initial placement and the precise manipulation of furniture dimensions.
Additionally, our sole participant with over 10 years of architecture experience suggest we offer control over window heights, ceiling heights, and window finishes.These features are most commonly found in daylight analysis software; these features are  important if I plan to define OASIS as a tool for daylighting analysis.
Interestingly, an unanticipated situation with participants' feedback was discovered when analyzing the feedback for this question.
A few of our 14 participants provided duplicate responses from previously asked questions.
Table-\ref{fig:features} displays all responses collected that were not duplicate responses to previous questions.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Feedback to the question: What additional features should be added to the system to allow greater flexibility in design?}
\label{fig:features}
\end{table}


In addition to collecting feature request feedback, I also ask participants to describe some designs that they were unable to create due to system limitations.
Table-\ref{fig:limitation} shows participants feedback on limitations of designs in our sketching interface.
The most common design limitation observed was the absence of doors in our sketching interface.
From the feedback collected, it seems that participants assumed that they could not design multi-room sketches because of the lack of doors in the sketching interface.
In actuality, previous user studies have confirmed that the physical sketch interpretation algorithm can handle multi-room designs.
Other design limitations participants claimed to face included the lack of light shelves in our interface, the inability to place one piece of furniture on top of another, and unavailability of control over scale.
Again, participants also expressed that our selection of furniture items limited their designs. \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Feedback to the question: Describe some designs that you were not able to create due  to system limitations. }
\label{fig:limitation}
\end{table}




Similarly, Table-\ref{fig:dislike} list out participant feedback regarding disliked elements of our sketching interface.
A common dislike in our sketching interface was the absence of scale.
Currently, we convey scale indirectly through statically sized furniture items, however feedback suggest that we make scale more explicit to users.
A solution to this problem would be to overlay a grid with units representing feedback on the sketching interface. This would communicate to users scale without indirectly using furniture.
Interestingly, a participant expressed dislike with our interface because we do not support keyboard shortcuts for common actions, such as undo.
At the time we do not plan on supporting keyboard shortcuts as we are trying to create a sketching interface that might eventually be used with just a digital pen and tablet.
Other dislikes with our sketching interface include the limited collection of furniture we support, absence of doors, the inability to move walls after initial placement, and the the lack of accuracy when selecting a geographical locations for sketches.

\begin{table}[!ht]

\begin{tabular}{|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.8\textwidth}|}
\hline
\rowcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF} 
\textbf{Username} & \textbf{Response} \\ \hline
dcheung3 & There wasn't any real-time measurements when making the walls and windows that would have been beneficial in capturing more accurate model. \\ \hline

tranthang & Cant move the walls \\ \hline
Solyha & I would like a graph in the background so that I could be more accurate with the dimensions. \\ \hline
Jan Selz & I have a Building Information Modeling program open in the background.,I kept wanting to use commands and shortcuts for that program and it was difficult to simply just draw.,(more personal issue than program issue) \\ \hline
mindykay & Nope! \\ \hline
qjkxkcd & The location selector could be easier to use accurately but I guess it's not really important. An ``undo'' feature might be handy also. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Feedback to the question: Was there anything you did not like about working in this sketching environment?}
\label{fig:dislike}
\end{table}



Lastly, we asked participants if there were any elements in our interface that were hard to use.
Feedback from that question can be seen on Table-\ref{fig:hard2use}.
Many participants responded to this question with stating nothing was hard to use on OASIS.
However, a few users experienced software bugs with the interface and used this feedback question as a means to report them to us.
Aside from a few fixable software bugs, of which did not impact the entire system, a participant found the redundancy of Raphael FreeTransform handles confusing.
FreeTransform handles are three white circles that are overlaid onto furniture items when clicked in our sketching interface.
One circle appears at the center of the furniture item, and the two other circles are placed perpendicularly some distance away from the furniture item, as illustrated in Figure-\ref{fig:oldvh}F.
As of now, these two perpendicular handles are used solely to rotate items.
Participant feedback helps us note overlooked redundancies in our interface such as the two rotation FreeTransform handles that perform the same action.\\

\begin{table}[!ht]

qjkxkcd & Were (typo in the question) + Apparently walls can be removed with the ``Remove'' operation, but it seems like furniture can't be + Also, when furniture is added, there are 3 white points that can be used to manipulate it; the center one controls the position, and both of the others rotate the object. Is one meant to resize it? Or are they supposed to do the same thing \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Feedback to the question: Where there any elements of the user interface that were hard to use or confusing?}
\label{fig:hard2use}
\end{table}

To completely analyze the feedback collected from our sketching interface we must understand that omission of feedback could potentially be used to communicate feedback.
For example, when asked about negative aspects of our interface many users choose to respond with ``no'' or ``none''.
However, some participants, whom readily provide feedback, may decide to omit feedback for specific questions to communicate an implied ``no''.
Ambiguous omissions of feedback poses a problem for analysis. 
For example, I cannot assume that users imply there are no negative elements on our sketching interface based on user omission of specific feedback questions, although participants may intentionally omitted feedback.
Improvements in how I collect participant feedback need be made to remove ambiguity in omitting feedback.
On a similar note, participants' feedback sometimes does not directly answer corresponding questions asked.
Occasionally, participants' feedback would be more appropriate as the response to another question.
I suspect that participants do not revise feedback after submitting; as a result some of our responses seem similar for multiple questions. \\

Despite all of this, the sketching interface garnered overall positive feedback from our participants.
Many participants claimed that the interface was easy to use and interesting.
 
\section{Model Based Feedback}

There are currently 73 models on OASIS and on average each user generates 1.25 models.
The distribution of the number of models made per user is illustrated in Figure-\ref{fig:model_hist}.
From Figure-\ref{fig:model_hist} we can see that most of our participants only crated a single model.
A handful of participants, however, created more than 9 models on our interface.
While the number of models per users is relatively low, the number of renovations per models show that on average there are 1.9 renovations per model created.
Specifically, there are about 134 renovations on OASIS.
Figure-\ref{fig:rel} illustrates the relationship between models and renovations.
Figure-\ref{fig:renvo_hist} shows the distribution of models and the number of renovations on these models.
%Analysis of individual models is out of the scope of this thesis, however, I do display some user created models in Figure-\ref{fig:examples}. \\

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{matching_chart}
	\caption{Accuracy in relation to model complexity}
	\label{fig:matching_chart}
\end{figure}

After creating a 3D model participants can voluntarily provide feedback concerning the accuracy of our interpretation.
A participant can state if the  interpretation of their sketch initially matched their intention,  matched after performing adjustments, or did not a match at all.
I hypothesized that as models grew more complex the accuracy of our interpretation algorithm would decrease.
Figure-\ref{fig:matching_chart} illustrates model complexity in relation to matching user intentions.
For this investigation I define model complexity as the number of primitives used to create a sketch. This simple metric does not capture the shape complexity of a model.
Figure-\ref{fig:matching_chart} is interesting because models regardless of complexity seem to always match users initial intentions without requiring renovations.
Even models with 20 to 29 primitives seem to always match.
While the data suggest that our physical sketch interpretation algorithm is accurate, I believe that more feedback is required before any statistically significant conclusions can be drawn.
From our collected data is clear that participants do not answer this specific feedback question readily.
We believe users aren't consciously omitting this question because they are just excited to get into the daylight rendering phase.
In order to better gauge our accuracy, changes to the interface need to be made to persuade participants to answer this feedback question. \\




Aside from categorical quantitative feedback, we also ask participants to quantitatively describe their overall impressions of the system's effectiveness in the construction of 3D models from users' sketches; 
Table-\ref{fig:effective} displays results from this feedback questions.
Of the 16 participants that provided feedback on the effectiveness of the physical sketch interpretation algorithm, 14 stated that the system generally matched their intentions.
One participant stated that they only saw 2D versions of the interpretation.
I presume this could be caused from the user either not rotating their model or limited WebGL support on their web browser.
I do  not currently collect meta data on participants' web browsers or cursor movements, so currently there is no explanation for the problem encountered by this participant.
Two participants mentioned the lack of support for doors hindered the effectiveness of generating 3D models.
One participant linked us an image in their feedback, that displayed a rendering issue they had encountered.
The detail of some of the qualitative feedback provided from participants was higher than originally expected.
A take away from participants taking screen shots, hosting images online, and linking images of problem renderings to us is that OASIS should provide an easier means to associate feedback to models.

\end{table}

Moreover, we asked users to describe cases where models were incorrectly interpreted by our physical sketch interpretation algorithm.
Table-\ref{fig:failure} present participant feedback about these failure cases.
Eight participants provided feedback on failure cases, however, some feedback provided is difficult to analyze.
Two  participants claim there were no issues in our interpretations of their sketches.
Particularly, three participants provided feedback making references to problems on specific models without images or model titles for us to associate the feedback with.
Only one participant provided a hyper-link to an image of a model they encountered problems with.
I suspect the other two participants believed OASIS kept track of which model users were viewing when providing feedback.
This particular feedback question is a general system wide question, so I did not anticipate that users would associate this question with the model currently being viewed by the participant.
Furthermore, another participant misinterpreted the question and stated that the lack of lofted beds in the system was a limitation to design.
Another participant was unhappy with design choices we made that deviate from standard modeling software conventions for viewing the 3D interpreted sketches. 
The main purpose of viewing the  3D interpretation of a sketch is to confirm that the interpretation matched users' intentions. As mentioned previously in section-\ref{3dviewer} future iterations of OASIS might do away with this viewer and incorporate it during user sketching.

Feedback on failure cases demonstrated the importance of linking feedback to models in the system rather then  simply describing those cases through just written feedback.
Descriptions of a failure cases without reference models proved to be ambiguous and unhelpful in  diagnosing users' issues.

qjkxkcd & Part of the room is kind of an L-shape. When viewed from certain angles, it looks like one wall extends farther than it does in the 2d representation (http://imgur.com/qnGfydB). (Note: this was also fixed by completing the wall which was previously left open) + Also the window is only visible looking out from inside the room (the wall looks solid from the outside). +  And it might be by design, but the black circle base is only visible when looking at the model from above, not below. \\ \hline

\section{Daylighting Analysis Feedback}


The final set of qualitative feedback I collect in our pilot user study, concerns participants' experience with daylighting in OASIS.
Specifically we ask participants if they understood the results of daylight simulations and to describe anything they found unclear or confusing about our visualizations.
Table-\ref{fig:understood} contains user feedback about participants' comprehension of simulation results.
Note that the feedback collected in Figure-\ref{fig:understood} is associated with a specific rendering.
I anticipated that users would understand some simulation results for a given rendering but not understand all simulation results. Accordingly, I made sure to associate this question with specific renderings for future analysis.
Surprisingly, participants' responses between renderings did not vary. 
Out of the 10 participants that provided feedback 9 claimed to understand simulation results.
One participant expected daylight from a north facing window at noon in the norther hemisphere;
This participant might not have known that there is no direct sunlight from northern-facing fenestrations in the northern hemisphere.
Users misconceptions about daylight are covered in a previous users study on the Virtual Heliodion.

dcheung3 & Yes, I understand the results of the simulation. \\ \hline
h.tran1990 & Yes, this is very well thought out and it is a great program \\ \hline
flowerJane & I thought that maybe there would be light shining through since I set the time to  12 pm, but there was none \\ \hline
durkeejw & Yes, Straightforward \\ \hline
alanlang & i understood the simulation \\ \hline
dcheung3 & Yes, I understand the results of the simulation. From the data, it would seem that the rooms are over illuminated and this simulation clearly indicates as such. \\ \hline
ryasoa & I understood the results of the simulation. I think something that needs to be taken into consideration is the reflection of other buildings because while the simulation looks very nice + ( I prefer the dark at this time) my room is VERY bright at this time and I think it may be due to the surrounding building reflections \\ \hline
mindykay & Everything was perfect! As expected. The analysis part is really convenient as well! + I wish there was an ability to close the application to ensure my feedback was saved. I see it was saved because it says it at the bottom of the screen, but it be nice to have an exit button to close the window and ensure that all feedback was marked down. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Feedback to the question: Did you understand the results of the simulation? Describe anything confusing or unclear.}
\label{fig:understood}
\end{table}

Lastly we asked participants if the system allowed them to test daylighting performance and if they understood over and under illumination visualizations. Figure-\ref{fig:effective} shows that of the 10 participants that provided feedback, seven participants provided positive statements. In general, participants understood over and under illumination and claimed that OASIS was useful for daylighting performance and analysis. Interestingly, our most experienced user claimed that OASIS was not effective for daylighting analysis.The user stated that they did not understand what under and over illumination thresholds were relative to. OASIS does not currently support adjusting thresholds for under and over illumination. Adjusting these thresholds for common activities, such as office work, are left as future implementation.In the course of this pilot user study, the feedback from our participant with over 10 years work experience in architecture was constructive. Similarly, the feedback from the non-experts is invaluable in regards to future user interface decisions.

\section{Chapter Summary}

In the beginning of our user study we set out to prove that if OASIS is publicized to users online, then anonymous online users will construct models in our sketching interface and create daylight renderings for analysis.
From the 57  users who registered with OASIS and the dozens of users that generated models and renderings, I can say that our plan of creating an online interface for key components in the virtual Heliodon was a success.
Users, without formal training or an operator managed to use OASIS with minimal help features.
The users that provided feedback data about themselves showed us that they all come from a variety of educational background. 
Additionally, it showed us that they have experience in many 3D modeling tools that we did not consider for this pilot user study.
Moreover, the data showed that the number of users who visit OASIS and created accounts only to leave is remarkably high.
Regardless, the feedback we did collect from our users helps us plan for future features on OASIS, such as the support for doors and more furniture items. 
We generally garnered positive feedback from users on all aspects of OASIS, while we would like to be excited by this, the number of users considered in our pilot users study is too small to confidently make statistically significant claims about OASIS.
