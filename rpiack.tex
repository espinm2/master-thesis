\specialhead{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}

The Online Architectural Sketching Interface for Simulations (OASIS) was made possible thanks to the continual support of my masters committee members including Dr. Barbara Cutler, Dr. Charles Stewart, and Dr. Randolph Franklin.
While I originally started OASIS many contributions and final polishings of the interface were made with the help of my lab mates Joshua Nasman, Eric Zhang, Sensen Chen, Jim Olyha, and Jeramey Tyler. I would also like to thank Jason Parham and Jon Crall, both of which were always  available to answer any question I could throw at them. Most importantly, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Barbara Cutler, for using her experience in computer graphics and architecture to help guide the creation of OASIS. I would also like to acknowledge the National Science Foundation for both funding and supporting this thesis under grant A12016 NSF, Immersive Architectural Daylighting Design Experience.

Finally, I want to thank both my parents James and Lourdes Espinoza for their unfaltering support of my education and the kind of wisdom and love only a parent can bestow. 
I would also like to give a shout out to my sister Marina Espinoza.
Last, but by no means least, I would like to thank my girlfriend Mindy Khamvongsa, for all her love and support throughout my graduate education.


%  \textit{The Great Zebra \& Giraffe Count} (GZGC) was powered and administered by the IBEIS team with notable help from Dr.\ Paula Kahumbu and staff at Wildlife Direct in Nairobi, Kenya.  The IBEIS team would like to thank the people and government of Kenya for supporting this research (Permit \# NACOSTI/P/14/1003/1628), with special recognition to Senior Warden of the Nairobi National Park, Nely Palmeris, and Macharia ``Michael'' Kimura of the Kenyan Wildlife Service (KWS).  Other contributions to this thesis were provided by Clara Machogu, Marco Maggioni, Jon Crall, Hendrik Weideman, Michael Brown, and Zachary Jablons.  I would like to thank Dr.\ Tanya Berger-Wolf, Dr.\ Daniel Rubenstein, and my master committee members, Dr.\ Barbara Cutler and Dr.\ B{\"u}lent Yener, for their valuable feedback.  I would also like to give a special thank you to my Ph.D.\ advisor, Dr.\ Charles Stewart, who has patiently guided me to this milestone of my academic career.
